## Azure Bot Services Overview

Azure Bot Service provides an integrated environment that is purpose-built for bot development, enabling developer to build, connect, test, deploy, and manage intelligent bots, all from one place. Azure Bot Service leverages the Bot Framework SDK with support for C#, JavaScript, Python and Java. Through the use of modular and extensible framework provided by the SDK, tools, templates, and AI services developers can create bots that use speech, understand natural language, handle questions and answers, and more.[@sp20-516-238-azure-bot-service-overview]

The service can be added to websites, apps, email, GroupMe, Facebook Messenger, Kik, Skype, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, SMS, Twilio, Cortana and Skype for Business. (see @fig:azure-bot-service-channels)

## What is a bot?

Bots provide an experience that feels less like using a computer and more like dealing with a person or an intelligent robot. Bots can be used to shift simple, repetitive tasks, such as taking a dinner reservation or gathering profile information, on to automated systems that may no longer require direct human intervention. Users converse with a bot using text, interactive cards, and speech. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a sophisticated conversation that intelligently provides access to services.

Bots are a lot like modern web applications, living on the internet and use APIs to send and receive messages. Modern bot software relies on a stack of technology and tools to deliver increasingly complex experiences on a wide variety of platforms. However, a simple bot could just receive a message and echo it back to the user with very little code involved.

Bots can do the same things other types of software can do - read and write files, use databases and APIs, and do the regular computational tasks. What makes bots unique is their use of mechanisms generally reserved for human-to-human communication.

## Applications

Azure Bot Framework provides a set of templates, solution accelerators and skills to help build sophisticated conversational experiences.
