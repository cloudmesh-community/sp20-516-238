# AI Services on Azure

Azure AI is a set of AI services built on Microsoftâ€™s research and innovation in vision, speech, language processing, and custom machine learning [sp20-516-238-azure-bot-service-overview]. 

**Azure AI helps organizations:**

* Develop machine learning models that can help with scenarios such as demand forecasting, recommendations, or fraud detection using Azure Machine Learning.
* Incorporate vision, speech, and language understanding capabilities into AI applications and bots, with Azure Cognitive Services and Azure Bot Service.
* Build knowledge-mining solutions to make better use of untapped information in their content and documents using Azure Search.

## Azure Machine Learning

Azure Machine Learning can be used for any kind of machine learning, from classical ml to deep learning, supervised, and unsupervised learning. From writing Python or R code or zero-code/ low-code options such as the designer, Azure Machine Learning Workspace can help build, train, and track highly accurate machine learning and deep-learning models [sp20-516-238-azure-machine-learning].

Azure Machine Learning provides rich set of tools required by developers and data scientists, which includes:

*  The Azure Machine Learning designer (preview): drag-n-drop modules to build your experiments and then deploy pipelines.
* Jupyter notebooks: use our example notebooks or create your own notebooks to leverage our SDK for Python samples for your machine learning.
* R scripts or notebooks in which you use the SDK for R to write your own code, or use the R modules in the designer.
* Visual Studio Code extension
* Machine learning CLI
* Open-source frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn and many more
